# Evaluation Pipeline

How Intaris classifies, evaluates, and decides on every tool call.

## Overview

Every tool call passes through this pipeline:

```

    ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│  Session Status  │──── suspended/terminated/completed → DENY (fast)
│     Check        │
└────────┬─────────┘
         │ active/idle
         ▼
┌──────────────────┐

## Classification

The classifier determines whether a tool call needs LLM evaluation or can be fast-pathed.

### Classification Priority Chain

Checked in order -- first match wins:

| Step | Check | Result | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Session policy `deny_tools` / `deny_commands` | **CRITICAL** | Admin-defined deny rules |
| 1.5 | Session policy `deny_paths` | **CRITICAL** | Filesystem path deny (fnmatch) |
| 2 | Tool preference deny | **CRITICAL** | Per-tool MCP preference |
| 3 | Tool preference escalate | **ESCALATE** | Per-tool MCP preference |
| 4 | Session policy `allow_tools` / `allow_commands` | **READ** | Admin-defined allow rules |
| 5 | Tool preference auto-approve | **READ** | Per-tool MCP preference |
| 6 | Critical pattern detection (bash) | **CRITICAL** | Dangerous commands (rm -rf, etc.) |
| 7 | Built-in read-only allowlist | **READ** | Known safe tools and commands |
| 7.5 | Path outside project boundary | **WRITE** | Forces LLM evaluation for out-of-project reads |
| 8 | Default | **WRITE** | Everything else goes through LLM |

### Read-Only Allowlist

Tools that are always classified as READ (auto-approved):

**Built-in tools:** `read`, `glob`, `grep`, `search`, `find`, `list`, `get`, `view`, `show`, `describe`, `explain`, `help`, `info`, `status`, `whoami`, `version`, `todoread`, `todowrite`

**Bash commands:** `ls`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `find`, `tree`, `wc`, `grep`, `rg`, `fd`, `pwd`, `echo`, `which`, `file`, `stat`, `du`, `df`, `env`, `printenv`, `uname`, `hostname`, `whoami`, `id`, `date`, `uptime`, `diff`, `sort`, `uniq`, `cut`, `jq`, `yq`, and more.

**Git subcommands:** `status`, `log`, `diff`, `show`, `branch`, `tag`, `remote`, `stash list`, `config --get`, `rev-parse`, `ls-files`, `ls-tree`, `shortlog`, `describe`, `blame`, `reflog`

### Critical Patterns

Bash commands that are always classified as CRITICAL (auto-denied):

- `rm -rf /` and variants
- `chmod 777`
- `curl | sh`, `wget | sh` (pipe to shell)
- `dd if=` (raw disk operations)
- `mkfs`, `fdisk`, `parted` (disk formatting)
- `iptables`, `ufw` (firewall changes)
- `shutdown`, `reboot`, `halt`, `poweroff`
- `kill -9`, `killall`
- Environment variable manipulation (`export`, `unset` of sensitive vars)

### Filesystem Path Protection

When `working_directory` is set on a session, the classifier enforces filesystem boundaries:

1. **Path extraction**: File paths are extracted from tool arguments using known keys (`filePath`, `file_path`, `path`, `directory`, etc.). Relative paths are resolved against `working_directory`.

2. **Deny paths** (step 1.5): Paths matching `deny_paths` patterns are classified as CRITICAL. Always checked, even when the approved paths cache has entries.

3. **Out-of-project override** (step 7.5): Read-only tools targeting paths outside the project directory are reclassified as WRITE, forcing LLM evaluation.

4. **Allow paths**: Paths matching `allow_paths` patterns are exempt from the out-of-project override.

5. **Approved path prefix cache**: When the LLM approves an out-of-project read, the evaluator caches the approved directory prefix. Subsequent reads under that prefix are fast-pathed without LLM evaluation. Max 50 prefixes per session, FIFO eviction.

## Model Safety Evaluation

Tool calls classified as WRITE are sent to the configured evaluator backend.
`EVALUATOR_BACKEND=llm` uses the OpenAI-compatible evaluator;
`EVALUATOR_BACKEND=jev` uses TypeSafe Jev typed questions. Setting a dedicated
`DECISIONS_API_KEY` selects native Decisions as primary L1 regardless of that
legacy selector. The Jev client remains available for parent/child alignment
when `EVALUATOR_BACKEND=jev`; Decisions does not replace it there.

### Evaluation Context

The evaluator receives:

- **Tool name and arguments** (redacted)
- **Session intention** (what the user is trying to accomplish)
- **Parent intention** (if child session, for defense-in-depth)
- **Project path** (if `working_directory` is set)
- **Behavioral alert** (if the user has a high/critical risk profile)
- **Recent tool history** (last few tool calls for context)

### Classification Output

The LLM backend returns a JSON object:

```json
{
  "aligned": true,
  "risk": "low",
  "reasoning": "The grep command searches for test patterns in the test directory, directly supporting the stated intention.",
  "decision": "approve"
}
```

Fields:
- **aligned** (boolean): Whether the tool call aligns with the session intention
- **risk** (`low` | `medium` | `high` | `critical`): Security risk level
- **reasoning** (string): Explanation of the assessment
- **decision** (`approve` | `deny` | `escalate`): LLM's recommended decision

The Jev backend asks independent typed questions for the same alignment, risk,
and disposition dimensions. It validates the complete probability
distributions. If any dimension is below `JEV_MINIMUM_CONFIDENCE`, the result
is normalized to a high-risk escalation so uncertainty can never become an
approval or an uncertain critical denial. Since Jev does not generate prose,
Intaris creates factual audit text from the selected labels, probabilities,
and exact returned model version.

The native Decisions backend asks a predicate for alignment and choices for
risk and disposition, using the same full context and untrusted-data boundaries.
It requires exactly those named answers and complete finite choice
distributions. Its provisional confidence floor is 0.8: alignment confidence
is `max(p, 1-p)`; choice confidence is the lesser of the reported confidence
and the probability of the selected label. Refusal or any score below the floor
maps to high-risk escalation for review, not to approval. Malformed responses
fail the evaluation. This threshold needs calibration on representative calls;
the model supplies labels and scores, not generated rationale. Backend/model,
scores and allowlisted nonnegative token counts (input/output tokens, cached/
cache-write input details, reasoning output details) are recorded as
non-sensitive metadata; unknown provider usage fields are omitted. Choice
distributions must sum to 1 within 1e-6, an Intaris validation policy, not a
guarantee of the Decisions API contract. Explicit escalations
survive the decision matrix; existing `maximum_outcome` caps still apply.

### Timeout

Default: 4000ms (`LLM_TIMEOUT_MS` or `JEV_TIMEOUT_MS`). Must be under
the 5-second circuit breaker in client integrations. With Decisions,
`DECISIONS_TIMEOUT_MS` defaults to 2000ms; `LLM_TIMEOUT_MS` is a cooperative
budget for primary plus optional legacy fallback. Only network failures
(including server disconnects), timeouts, HTTP 429 and 5xx
trigger fallback when a generative LLM key is configured and time remains.
Provider 4xx, malformed answers, refusals and low confidence never trigger
fallback. Without an LLM fallback, transient failures return HTTP 503;
protocol errors return 500. These failures never authorize the tool call.
The primary is allocated at most half the budget with fallback configured;
per-phase HTTP timeouts are inactivity limits, not hard wall-clock bounds.
The shared deadline is checked after the primary response and when allocating
remaining time for fallback, not by interrupting an in-flight request; half
the time is not guaranteed to remain for fallback. Jev does not use this fallback.

## Decision Matrix

The decision matrix applies priority-ordered rules to the LLM evaluation result:

| Priority | Condition | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Critical risk (any alignment) | **Deny** -- auto-denied regardless of alignment |
| 2 | LLM explicitly said "deny" | **Deny** -- LLM override |
| 3 | Aligned + low risk | **Approve** |
| 4 | Aligned + medium risk | **Approve** |
| 5 | Aligned + high risk | **Escalate** -- requires human review |
| 6 | Not aligned (any risk) | **Escalate** -- requires human review |

### Evaluation Paths

Each decision is tagged with the path that produced it:

| Path | Description |
|---|---|
| `fast` | Read-only auto-approve, escalation retry, or session status deny |
| `critical` | Critical pattern auto-deny |
| `llm` | Configured model safety evaluation -> decision matrix |
| `alignment` | Alignment misalignment escalation (child vs parent intention) |

## Escalation Workflow

When a tool call is escalated:

1. **Audit record** created with `decision=escalate`
2. **Judge review** (if `JUDGE_MODE` is `auto` or `advisory`): a more capable LLM automatically reviews the escalation with richer session context (30 recent tool calls + reasoning records). The judge can approve, deny, or defer to a human. See [Judge Auto-Resolution](#judge-auto-resolution) below.
3. **Resolved outcome** is returned inline from `POST /evaluate` when the judge reaches a final decision.
4. **Webhook + escalation notification** fire only if the final effective outcome is still unresolved human review (`decision=escalate`).
5. **Client** only blocks and polls `GET /audit/{call_id}` when `POST /evaluate` still returns `decision=escalate`.
6. **Resolution** is recorded via judge auto-resolution or human `POST /api/v1/decision`.

When a **human** approves an escalation with a note, Intaris also triggers a
best-effort intention refresh for that session. The approval note is treated as
authoritative scope guidance for later evaluations, so long-lived sessions can
shift away from stale topics without requiring an exact retry of the same tool
arguments.

### Judge Auto-Resolution

When `JUDGE_MODE` is enabled (`auto` or `advisory`), `POST /evaluate` waits for the judge before returning its final effective/public decision. The audit log still keeps the raw evaluator decision in `audit_log.decision`, but clients should treat the HTTP response as the public contract.

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `disabled` (default) | No judge. Escalations require human resolution. |
| `auto` | Judge auto-resolves: approve or deny. Denies if uncertain (low confidence or defer). `POST /evaluate` never returns an intermediate `escalate` in this mode on successful judge completion; only judge failure or timeout degrades to unresolved human review. |
| `advisory` | Judge reviews: approve, deny, or defer to human. Deferred escalations remain unresolved with judge reasoning visible in the UI, and only then does `POST /evaluate` return `decision=escalate`. |

**Notification modes** (`JUDGE_NOTIFY_MODE`):
- `deny_only` (default): Only notify when judge denies.
- `always`: Notify on judge approvals/denials and on final unresolved escalations after judge defer/failure.
- `never`: Fully silent — no notifications in judge mode.

**Fail-open**: If the judge LLM fails or times out, `POST /evaluate` degrades to an unresolved `escalate` and human review is required.

**Race condition**: If a human resolves before the judge finishes, the atomic `WHERE user_decision IS NULL` guard prevents double-resolution. `POST /evaluate` re-reads persistence and returns the winning effective decision.

### Raw vs Effective Decision

- **Raw decision**: `audit_log.decision`, the evaluator's immediate output. For judge-reviewed calls this often remains `"escalate"`.
- **Effective/public decision**: the final outcome exposed by `POST /evaluate`. This is derived from persisted resolution state (`user_decision`, `resolved_by`, `judge_*`) after judge handling completes.
- For analytics or UI work that needs the final outcome, prefer the effective decision semantics instead of reading `audit_log.decision` in isolation.

Judge decisions are visible in the Approvals tab with a "judge" badge and the judge's reasoning alongside the original evaluator reasoning.

### Escalation Retry

When a tool call is escalated and later approved (by human or judge), subsequent identical calls (same tool + same args) reuse the approval for 10 minutes. Identity is based on SHA-256 of the normalized arguments JSON.

This retry cache is intentionally exact-match only. For later **similar** calls
with different arguments, Intaris relies on the session intention plus the
dedicated human-decision context injected into evaluator and judge prompts.

### Standalone Mode

Without a webhook configured, escalations are denied by default with a message directing the user to the Intaris UI. With the management UI, users can still approve escalations manually. With the judge enabled, escalations can be auto-resolved without any human interaction.

## Rate Limiting

Per-session sliding window rate limiter. Tracks call timestamps per `(user_id, session_id)` pair. Configured via `RATE_LIMIT` (default 60 calls/minute, 0 = disabled). Returns HTTP 429 when exceeded.

The rate limit check runs before classification and LLM evaluation.

## Secret Redaction

All tool arguments are redacted before audit storage. The redactor catches:

- **Pattern-based**: API keys, passwords, connection strings, JWTs, private keys, AWS credentials
- **Key-name-based**: Any argument key containing `password`, `token`, `secret`, `key`, `credential`, `auth`

Redaction always returns a deep copy -- input arguments are never mutated.
