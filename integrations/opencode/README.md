# OpenCode Integration -- Guardrails

A plugin for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) that evaluates every tool call through Intaris's safety pipeline before allowing execution.

## Integration Approaches

Intaris offers two integration approaches for OpenCode. Choose one -- do **not** use both simultaneously, or tool calls will be evaluated twice.

### Approach A: Plugin (Recommended)

The `intaris.ts` plugin intercepts every tool call via `tool.execute.before` and evaluates it through Intaris's REST API. This gives you:

- Fine-grained control over error messages
- Configurable fail-open/fail-closed behavior
- Session lifecycle management
- Structured logging via OpenCode's log system
- Behavioral analysis: periodic checkpoints, session completion signals, agent summaries

### Approach B: MCP Proxy

Configure Intaris as a remote MCP server. OpenCode connects to Intaris's `/mcp` endpoint, which transparently proxies all tool calls through the safety pipeline. This gives you:

- Zero plugin code -- just configuration
- Full MCP proxy features (tool preferences, escalation retry, tool namespacing)
- Works with any MCP-compatible client

The trade-off is less control over the UX (no custom error messages, no fail-open option).

## Setup -- Plugin (Approach A)

### 1. Environment Variables

The plugin makes direct HTTP calls to the Intaris REST API. Set these in your shell profile:

```bash
export INTARIS_URL=http://localhost:8060
export INTARIS_API_KEY=your-api-key
export INTARIS_USER_ID=your-username       # required for single-key mode (INTARIS_API_KEY)
export INTARIS_AGENT_ID=opencode           # optional, defaults to "opencode"
export INTARIS_FAIL_OPEN=false             # optional, defaults to false
export INTARIS_INTENTION=""                # optional, auto-generated from cwd
export INTARIS_ALLOW_PATHS=~/src           # optional, allow reads from sibling projects
export INTARIS_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL=25      # optional, defaults to 25 (0=disabled)
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `INTARIS_URL` | `http://localhost:8060` | Intaris server URL |
| `INTARIS_API_KEY` | (empty) | API key for authentication. **Required** if Intaris has `INTARIS_API_KEY` or `INTARIS_API_KEYS` set. |
| `INTARIS_AGENT_ID` | `opencode` | Agent ID sent to Intaris |
| `INTARIS_USER_ID` | (empty) | User ID. **Required** when using `INTARIS_API_KEY` (single-key mode) — the server needs a user identity to scope sessions and audit records. Optional if `INTARIS_API_KEYS` maps your key to a specific user. |
| `INTARIS_FAIL_OPEN` | `false` | If `true`, tool calls proceed when Intaris is unreachable. Default is `false` (fail-closed) -- tool calls are blocked when Intaris is down. |
| `INTARIS_INTENTION` | (auto) | Session intention override. Default: `"OpenCode coding session in <cwd>"` |
| `INTARIS_ALLOW_PATHS` | (empty) | Comma-separated parent directories to allow reads from without LLM evaluation. Supports `~` expansion. E.g., `~/src` allows reads from all projects under `~/src/`. |
| `INTARIS_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` | `25` | Number of evaluate calls between periodic checkpoints. Set to `0` to disable checkpoints. Each checkpoint consumes one rate limit slot. |
| `INTARIS_ESCALATION_TIMEOUT` | `0` | Seconds to wait for human approval of an escalation or overridable denial (`0` waits indefinitely). |

### 2. Install the Plugin

Copy `intaris.ts` to your OpenCode plugins directory:

```bash
# Global (recommended -- guardrails apply to all projects)
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/plugins
cp intaris.ts ~/.config/opencode/plugins/

# Or project-level
mkdir -p .opencode/plugins
cp intaris.ts .opencode/plugins/
```

Local plugins are loaded automatically -- no config entry needed.
After updating an existing plugin installation, copy the new `intaris.ts` into that installation and restart OpenCode to load it.

### 3. Verify

Run OpenCode with `--print-logs` and look for:

```
[intaris] Plugin initialized
[intaris] Session created: oc-<session-id>
```

### Testing the plugin hook

The executable hook regression requires built-in, unflagged TypeScript stripping: **Node.js 22.18+ (22.x), 23.6+ (23.x), or 24+**. Run from the repository root:

```bash
node --test integrations/opencode/denial-approval.test.mjs
```

The focused Python test invokes this command when a compatible Node is available; otherwise it explicitly skips the hook regression. No JavaScript dependencies or build step are needed.

## Setup -- MCP Proxy (Approach B)

Add to your `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (global) or `opencode.json` (project):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "intaris": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "http://localhost:8060/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-api-key",
        "X-Agent-Id": "opencode",
        "X-Intaris-Intention": "OpenCode coding session"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Configure upstream MCP servers in Intaris (via the UI, REST API, or `MCP_CONFIG_FILE`). OpenCode will see all upstream tools namespaced as `server_name:tool_name`.

See `opencode.json` in this directory for a complete example.

## Disabling OpenCode's Built-in Approvals

OpenCode has its own permission system that prompts for approval on certain actions (e.g., `external_directory` prompts when tools access paths outside the working directory). When using the Intaris plugin, this creates **double prompting** -- OpenCode asks first, then Intaris evaluates.

To let Intaris be the sole gatekeeper, disable OpenCode's built-in approvals in your `opencode.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  // Let Intaris handle all tool approval decisions
  "permission": "allow"
}
```

Or, to only disable the external directory prompt while keeping other OpenCode permissions:

```jsonc
{
  "permission": {
    "external_directory": "allow"
  }
}
```

See [OpenCode Permissions](https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/) for details.

## How It Works

### Plugin Flow

1. **`session.created`**: Creates an Intaris session via `POST /api/v1/intention` with the working directory as context. Child sessions (subagent tasks) are created with `parent_session_id` for session chain analysis.
2. **`tool.execute.before`**: Before every tool call:
   - Ensures an Intaris session exists (lazy creation for resumed sessions)
   - Calls `POST /api/v1/evaluate` with the tool name and arguments
   - **approve**: tool executes normally
   - **deny**: for tool-level critical/LLM denials with an audit ID, waits for an explicit human decision in the Intaris UI. The original denial remains a denial in the audit log; no decision is posted by the plugin. A human denial ends the wait; a judge denial may still be overridden by a human. Once a human approves, the plugin re-evaluates the original unchanged tool and arguments, and executes only if that fresh evaluation approves. Missing authorization, changed arguments, re-evaluation failure or any non-approval blocks execution even with `INTARIS_FAIL_OPEN=true`. Session status denials do not enter this ordinary denial wait (suspended sessions keep their separate reactivation flow).
   - **escalate**: polls only when `/evaluate` still returns unresolved escalation
   - Tracks per-decision statistics (approve/deny/escalate counts)
   - Sends periodic checkpoints via `POST /api/v1/checkpoint` (every N calls)
3. **`session.deleted`**: Signals session completion to Intaris:
   - `PATCH /api/v1/session/{id}/status` to `"completed"`
   - `POST /api/v1/session/{id}/agent-summary` with session statistics

During normal inactivity, the plugin uses `session.idle` to transition parent sessions to `idle` rather than `completed`. Child sessions still complete when they become idle.

While waiting on a tool-level denial, OpenCode keeps that tool call pending; the toast includes its audit ID for locating it in the Intaris UI. A judge-denied escalation may retain `decision=escalate` in the audit record; only a later human approval releases the wait. The wait uses the escalation polling backoff and `INTARIS_ESCALATION_TIMEOUT`. If it times out, the session is deleted, or the audit check fails, the original tool does not execute. Restarting OpenCode with an updated plugin is required to use this behavior.

### MCP Proxy Flow

1. OpenCode connects to Intaris at `/mcp` as a remote MCP server.
2. `tools/list` returns aggregated tools from all upstream servers.
3. `tools/call` evaluates each call through the safety pipeline before forwarding.

## Behavioral Analysis

The plugin supports Intaris's behavioral analysis pipeline (L1 data collection):

- **Periodic checkpoints**: Every `INTARIS_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` evaluate calls, the plugin sends a checkpoint with enriched content (call counts, decision breakdown, recent tool names). Checkpoints share the rate limit budget with evaluate calls.
- **Session completion**: When a session is explicitly deleted, the plugin signals completion (`PATCH /status`) and sends an agent summary with session statistics.
- **Parent session tracking**: Child sessions (subagent tasks) are created with `parent_session_id` linking them to the parent session for chain analysis.

**Limitation**: OpenCode does not fire a session-end event on normal exit. If the user closes OpenCode without deleting the session, the completion signal is not sent. The server's background sweep handles this by transitioning idle sessions after `SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`.

## Tool Name Conventions

When using the **plugin** approach, tool names are passed as-is from OpenCode to Intaris. OpenCode uses these tool names:

- Built-in tools: `read`, `edit`, `write`, `bash`, `glob`, `grep`
- MCP tools: The MCP tool name directly (e.g., `add_memory`, `search_memories`)

When configuring Intaris session policies (fnmatch patterns), use these names:

```json
{
  "policy": {
    "allow": ["read", "glob", "grep"],
    "deny": ["bash"]
  }
}
```

When using the **MCP proxy** approach, tools are namespaced as `server_name:tool_name` (e.g., `mnemory:add_memory`).

## Troubleshooting

- **"Evaluation failed" or "Evaluation rejected" with no server logs**: The server rejected the request before reaching the evaluation pipeline (HTTP 401). The most common cause is missing user identity: if you use `INTARIS_API_KEY` (single shared key), you **must** also set `INTARIS_USER_ID`. Without it, the server cannot determine which user the request belongs to. Alternatively, switch to `INTARIS_API_KEYS` on the server with a key mapped to your user_id.
- **Tool calls blocked unexpectedly**: Check that `INTARIS_URL` and `INTARIS_API_KEY` are set correctly. Run OpenCode with `--print-logs` to see evaluation decisions.
- **"Cannot create session" errors**: Verify Intaris is running and reachable at the configured URL.
- **All tool calls allowed**: Ensure the plugin is loaded (check for "Plugin initialized" in logs). If using `INTARIS_FAIL_OPEN=true`, Intaris may be unreachable.
- **Slow first tool call**: The first tool call creates an Intaris session (~1-2s) before evaluating. Subsequent calls are faster.
- **Double evaluation**: If you see each tool call evaluated twice, you may have both the plugin and MCP proxy configured. Use only one approach.
- **Checkpoints not appearing**: Verify `INTARIS_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` is not set to `0`. Check that the rate limit is not exhausted (checkpoints share the budget with evaluate calls).
